# Evaluation by ammarooni

This is the evaluation of 6 final project for Decred Blockchain Learning Challenge, Oct-Dec 2020.

Project | Acquisition and use of data | Relevance and specific conclusions of Decred | Functionality, ease of use and accessibility | Execution | Documentation | Total
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Digital Identity | 12 | 12 | 10 | 10 | 12 | 56
PoP | 15 | 18 | 15 | 18 | 15 | 81
Bitmoney | 14 | 10 | 12 | 13 | 16 | 65
DCRTimeExplorer | 15 | 17 | 15 | 17 | 15 | 79
DecredMemories | 15 | 15 | 14 | 10 | 10 | 64
iPati | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 50

**Digital Identity**: This is a good problem to choose, but it appears that you're going to end up with a new trusted party who has custody of the ID data. I would further explore why people will want to use this service as their trusted ID provider.

**People of Pi**: This is a creative idea, and has lots of future potential with Decred. You can also apply quality filters to see which contributed have the most valuable content on Pi. Well done.

**Bitmoney**: Price analysis is interesting, but it would be more interesting if you can show how this price model has historically performed when you compare it to the market.

**DCRTimeExplorer**: Creative use of digital timestamping and making it applicable to the Decred blockchain.

**Decred Memories**: This is a good idea to make a Decred snapshot with notable news and events. Documentation can improve, and you can further enhance this project by adding in notable social media data.

**iPati**: The video content was not subtitled in English, so I could not understand everything, but it seems unclear how this is this related to the Decred blockchain.
